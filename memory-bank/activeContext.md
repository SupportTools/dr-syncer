2. Test Implementation Requirements
   - Each test case must include:
     * README.md with consistent documentation
     * controller.yaml for Replication resource
     * remote.yaml for source resources
     * test.sh with standardized structure
   - Standard test script components:
     * Color coding and result tracking
     * Resource verification functions
     * Status checking
     * Detailed result reporting
     * Log command best practices:
       - Always use --tail to limit log output (e.g., kubectl logs pod-name --tail=100)
       - Never use -f/--follow flags in test scripts as they will never return
       - Use appropriate tail sizes based on verbosity needs (100 for normal, 1000 for debugging)
