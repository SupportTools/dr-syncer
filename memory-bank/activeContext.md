# Active Context: DR Syncer Controller

## Current State

### Implementation Status
1. Core Controller
   - Manager implementation complete
   - Reconciler patterns established
   - Resource handling implemented
   - Health checks integrated

2. Custom Resources
   - RemoteCluster CRD implemented and validated
   - Replication CRD implemented and validated
   - Resource definitions streamlined and optimized

3. Synchronization
   - Resource type filtering working
   - Deployment handling implemented
   - Service/Ingress management functional
   - Scheduling system operational

### Active Development Areas

1. Resource Synchronization
   - Current Focus: Resource type handling
   - Status: Implementing core sync logic
   - Priority: High
   - Next Steps: Testing and validation

2. Controller Logic
   - Current Focus: Reconciliation patterns
   - Status: Core implementation complete
   - Priority: Medium
   - Next Steps: Optimization and error handling

3. Deployment
   - Current Focus: Helm chart development
   - Status: Basic chart implemented
   - Priority: Medium
   - Next Steps: Chart testing and documentation

## Recent Changes

1. Core Features
   - Simplified CRD architecture to two core CRDs
   - Enhanced Replication CRD with comprehensive status fields
   - Integrated namespace mapping into Replication CRD
   - Added phase tracking (Pending, Running, Completed, Failed)
   - Added sync statistics tracking
   - Added per-resource status tracking
   - Added detailed error reporting
   - Improved kubectl visibility with new columns
   - Enhanced status update conflict logging with resource version tracking
   - Added debug logging for resource version changes during reconciliation

2. Resource Management
   - Added deployment replica handling
   - Implemented service recreation
   - Enhanced resource filtering
   - Added exclusion capabilities

3. Documentation
   - Updated API documentation
   - Enhanced deployment guides
   - Added troubleshooting section
   - Improved examples
   - Documented CRD update process

4. CRD Management
   - Streamlined CRD management with automated sync
   - Established Go types as single source of truth
   - Enhanced Helm chart CRD integration
   - Automated CRD sync via `make manifests`
   - Reduced CRD complexity by maintaining only remoteclusters and replications

## Active Decisions

1. Architecture
   - Using controller-runtime framework
   - Implementing custom reconcilers
   - Leveraging Kubernetes native patterns
   - Following operator best practices

2. Implementation
   - Go as primary language
   - CRDs for configuration
   - Helm for deployment
   - Prometheus for metrics

3. Resource Handling
   - Zero replicas in DR clusters (with label override support)
   - Preserving deployment metadata
   - Managing service recreation
   - Handling ingress configuration
   - Scale override via 'dr-syncer.io/scale-override' label
   - Resource exclusion via 'dr-syncer.io/ignore' label

## Current Considerations

1. Technical
   - Performance optimization
   - Resource usage monitoring
   - Error handling improvements
   - Testing coverage

2. Operational
   - Deployment strategies
   - Monitoring setup
   - Backup procedures
   - Upgrade processes

3. Documentation
   - API reference updates
   - Example enhancements
   - Troubleshooting guides
   - Best practices

4. CRD Updates
   - Go types are now single source of truth
   - CRDs automatically sync to Helm chart
   - Helm templating automatically applied
   - Only two CRDs maintained: remoteclusters and replications

## Next Steps

1. Short Term
   - Complete resource sync testing
   - Enhance error handling
   - Update documentation
   - Implement monitoring

2. Medium Term
   - Optimize performance
   - Enhance Helm chart
   - Add advanced features
   - Improve user guides

3. Long Term
   - Scale testing
   - Security enhancements
   - Feature expansion
   - Community engagement
