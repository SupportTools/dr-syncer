   - Preserving deployment metadata
   - Managing service recreation
   - Handling ingress configuration
   - Scale override via 'dr-syncer.io/scale-override' label
   - Resource exclusion via 'dr-syncer.io/ignore' label

## Current Considerations

1. Technical
   - Performance optimization
   - Resource usage monitoring
   - Error handling improvements
