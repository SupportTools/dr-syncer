## Project Intelligence

### Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
- DR-Syncer uses Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to configure and control its behavior
- The CRDs are defined in the `api/v1alpha1` package and generated using controller-gen
- Main CRDs:
  - RemoteCluster: Defines connection details for remote clusters
  - NamespaceMapping (renamed from Replication): Defines synchronization configuration between namespaces
  - Important Note: The "Replication" CRD was renamed to "NamespaceMapping" in 2025 to better reflect its purpose
  - Documentation, examples, and code references have been updated to use NamespaceMapping instead of Replication

### Go Code Styling Rules
- main.go should be minimal, serving only as entrypoint
- All packages under ./pkg/ directory
- Keep files under 300 lines by splitting into multiple files
- Group small utility functions in util.go within each package
- Each exported function requires detailed documentation comments
- Run go fmt ./... before committing code
- Make frequent, small git commits while coding to create recovery points
- Use git checkout [commit-hash] -- path/to/file.go to recover accidentally deleted code
- Group imports in three blocks: standard library, external deps, internal packages
- Break up large packages into multiple files with clear responsibilities

### Command Line Tools
- DR-Syncer provides two separate tools:
  1. Controller: Kubernetes operator that runs in-cluster
  2. CLI: Standalone command-line tool for direct operations

### Operational Guidelines
- CRD documentation in docs/docs/crd-reference.md 
- Examples for both controller and CLI in docs/docs/examples.md
- Always reference NamespaceMapping (not Replication) in documentation and examples
- When viewing logs:
  - Always use --tail flag to limit log output
  - Never use -f/--follow in scripts as these commands never return
  - Recommended: kubectl logs pod-name --tail=100

### Deployment Process
- Helm is the recommended installation method for the controller
- The CLI can be used without installing the controller
- Both tools can access the same clusters and namespaces

### Documentation Standards
- Always document both the controller and CLI options where applicable
- Use kind: NamespaceMapping in all YAML examples
- Maintain CLI usage documentation separately from controller documentation
