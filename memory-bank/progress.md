## Known Issues

### Critical
- SSH Key Management Issue: Controller fails to create separate SSH key secrets for each RemoteCluster when they use the same secret name. Fixed by updating RemoteCluster resources to use unique secret names for each cluster.

### Resolved
- [x] Controller-runtime logging panic - Fixed by implementing LogrusLogAdapter to properly integrate logrus with controller-runtime's logging system

### High Priority
1. Resource Handling
   - Occasional sync delays under heavy load
   - Resource version conflicts in edge cases
   - Memory usage spikes during large syncs

2. Performance
   - Scaling limitations with many resources
   - Network bandwidth consumption
   - Cache memory usage

### Medium Priority
1. Documentation
